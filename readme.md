## Introduction

The Article Summarizer is designed to help users quickly obtain summaries and insights from multiple news articles. By simply inputting URLs of news articles, the application processes the content, splits it into manageable chunks, and applies state-of-the-art NLP techniques to retrieve the most relevant information based on user queries.

## Features

- **🔗 URL-based Content Retrieval:** Input multiple article URLs for processing.
- **✂️ Text Splitting:** Automatically splits long articles into smaller, manageable chunks for better analysis.
- **🔍 Contextual Compression:** Uses Cohere's reranking model to compress and retrieve relevant content.
- **🗨️ Interactive Query Interface:** Users can ask questions related to the articles and receive concise, relevant answers.
- **💾 Session Persistence:** Maintains state across queries to provide a smooth user experience.
