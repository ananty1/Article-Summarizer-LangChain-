    "Rashmika Mandanna (/rəʃmɪkɑː mənðənɑː/; born 5 April 1996) is an Indian actress who predominantly works in Telugu, Kannada and Hindi films. She has received four SIIMA Awards and a Filmfare Award. One of South India's highest-paid actresses, she was featured in Forbes India's 2024 list of \"30 Under 30\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashmika made her acting debut with the Kannada romantic comedy Kirik Party (2016), and found further success in the action picture Anjani Putra and romance Chamak (both 2017). Her first Telugu film release came in the romantic comedy Chalo but the romance Geetha Govindam (both 2018) proved to be a turning point in her career and earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress – Telugu. She later played the leading lady in the Telugu action comedies Devadas (2018) and Sarileru Neekevvaru (2020), and the romance Bheeshma (2020). She had her first Tamil release in the action drama Sulthan (2021), and later achieved her top-grosser in the language with the action film Varisu (2023), though her inclination towards androcentric films drew criticism for providing only limited scope to showcase her acting abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashmika earned wider recognition as a head-strong girl in the action film Pushpa: The Rise (2021). After playing a supporting role in the Telugu period drama Sita Ramam (2022), she expanded to Hindi cinema and had her highest-grossing release with the action drama Animal (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to acting, Rashmika serves as the ambassador of several brands and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early and personal life\n",
    "Rashmika Mandanna was born on 5 April 1996 to Suman and Madan Mandanna into a Kodava Hindu family in Virajpet, a town in Kodagu district, Karnataka.[1][2] Her father owns a coffee estate and a function hall in her hometown, and her mother is a homemaker.[3] She has a younger sister, Shiman.[4] As a child, Rashmika's family struggled financially, and had difficulties finding a home and paying rent; according to Rashmika, her parents could not afford to buy her toys and the experience has continued to influence her relationship with money.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashmika attended Coorg Public School, a boarding school in Gonikoppal.[6] During this phase of her life, Rashmika was often misunderstood due to her struggles with communication, making connecting with her peers difficult.[7] Rashmika credits her mother for being stabilising influence in her life and labelled her \"my biggest strength\".[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashmika studied for a bachelor's degree in Psychology, Journalism and English Literature at M. S. Ramaiah College of Arts, Science and Commerce in Bangalore.[8] Despite her parents' initial hesitation towards Rashmika's pursuit of an acting career due to her unassertive personality, her parents granted her permission to go ahead with her plans.[9] In 2014, Rashmika was awarded The Times of India's Clean & Clear Fresh Face that recognizes individuals with the greatest potential for future success;[10] the award was presented to her by Akshay Kumar and she was subsequently made a brand ambassador for Clean & Clear as part of the winning reward.[11][12] This was followed by a brief career in modelling, which Rashmika believed would ease her transition into acting.[12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rashmika began dating Rakshit Shetty, her co-star in Kirik Party, during the making of the film, and they announced their engagement on 3 July 2017 at a private party in her hometown Virajpet.[13] They ended their engagement in September 2018, citing compatibility issues.[14]\n",

Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=ChatCohere(client=<cohere.client.Client object at 0x7f7fbffff010>, async_client=<cohere.client.AsyncClient object at 0x7f7fbffff6d0>, cohere_api_key=SecretStr('**********'))), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'CohereEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x7f7fc002bc70>))"
